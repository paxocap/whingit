Whingit is developed on LAMP. Its very simple to set up. Just bringup an apache server, set up your mysql and point it to /res/sql/db.sql

The home page (index.php) can be accessed using hostname:port/index.php.

To know more about Whingit and motivation behind the project check out whingit.ppx in the current folder and also seach "Greylock hackfest" on web.
It was made as a part of class project and majority of work was done during 24 hours hack at Dropbox.
